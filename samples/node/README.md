# Node service account sample

## Installation
`npm install`

## Getting access to the API
In order to give you access Connected Cars will create a service account for you.  
A service account has data that looks like the following:
```
----- BEGIN CONNECTEDCARS INFO -----
iss: XXX@XXX.serviceaccount.connectedcars.io
aud: https://auth-api.connectedcars.io/auth/login/serviceAccountConverter
kid: XXX
----- END CONNECTEDCARS INFO -----
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
YOU_CREATE_THIS
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

```
After you receive your service account data you must generate an RSA key pair.  
This can be done as follows:  
```bash
# Here the key is encrypted with aes256
openssl genrsa -aes256 -out private.pem 2048
```
Note: openssl now requires you to set a pass phrase for your private key, which you have to enter when running the above command. This is used to encrypt the key.  
To create an unencrypted key, do the following (you will be prompted for your pass phrase):
```bash
openssl rsa -in private.pem -out private_unencrypted.pem
```
Then generate public key from the unencrypted private key:
```bash
openssl rsa -in private_unencrypted.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem
```

Now put your unencrypted private key into the RSA key block of your service account data. Then send Connected Cars your public key. After confirmation from Connected Cars you will have access to the staging environment.  
After confirming that you can call the staging API you can get access to the production API.

## Installation
From this directory run `gradle build`

## Usage
This example shows how to use the Connected Cars GraphQL API.  
A `ConnectedCarsApi` class is provided in the `connectedcarsapi.js` file.  
The `config.js` file shows how to make a singleton of the `ConnectedCarsApi` class, which can be used throughout your project. This means you don't have to query the Connected Cars auth API everytime you want to call the GraphQL API.  

The `config.js` file shows how to load the Connected Cars service account data from a file, but this could of course be substituted by querying a database, by having the entirety of the service account data in an environment variable, or whatever else you choose. 

Connected Cars has two different environments you can call: a staging and a production environment. By default the production environment is called. To change this you change the `CC_API_ENDPOINT` and the `CC_AUTH_API_ENDPOINT` which are used in `config.js`. If no environment is provided to the `ConnectedCarsApi` class will default to the production environment. This is also where you find the `ORGANIZATION_NAMESPACE` environment variable. This is used to specify organization and namespace on your requests. Ask Connected Cars for more info.

How to use the API is shown in `index.js`. You import the API from the `config.js` file to make sure you use the same instance of the class everywhere in your project. Then you can call the API by invoking the `call` method like so:

``` js
const CCApi = require('./config')

const example = async () => {
  const getFirstname = `query User {
                        viewer {
                          id
                          email
                          firstname
                        }
                      }`

  try {
    const result = await CCApi.call(getFirstname)
    console.log(result)
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error during CC api call')
    console.error(err)
  }
}

example()
```

The `ConnectedCarsApi` class takes care of converting your serviceaccount info into a token, the caching of the token, and refreshing your token. 

## Try out the example against the staging environment
If your service account file is named `connectedcars_serviceaccount.pem` and is in the root of the project then you don't have to change anything.  
Otherwise, find the path to your Connected Cars service account file and enter it into the environment variable `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE` in the start script of `package.json`.  

Start the example by calling `npm start`. This will query your user details and print them. Then it sets the user name of your service account to `api-tester` and prints that.

To call the production environment simply change the endpoints in `npm start` or delete the `CC_API_ENDPOINT` and `CC_AUTH_API_ENDPOINT` environment variables in `package.json` to default to production.
